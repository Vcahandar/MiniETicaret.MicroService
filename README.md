### About MiniETicaret.MicroService
**MiniETicaret.MicroService** is a microservices-based e-commerce platform designed to demonstrate the scalability and flexibility of a modular architecture in a real-world application. This project serves as a foundational example of how to build a distributed e-commerce system using modern technologies and best practices.

## Key Features
+ Modular Architecture: Each service in the platform is independently developed, deployed, and scaled. This allows for easier maintenance and enhanced performance.
+ Scalable Infrastructure: Designed to handle increasing workloads by scaling individual services as needed.
+ RESTful APIs: The platform is driven by RESTful APIs, ensuring seamless communication between microservices.
+ Secure Transactions: Implemented secure payment gateways and user authentication to ensure data integrity and protection.
+ Extensible Design: The architecture allows for easy integration of new features and services without disrupting existing functionalities.

## Technologies Used
+ Microservices: Built with .NET Core to create loosely coupled and independently deployable services.
+ API Gateway: Utilized to manage API requests and route them to the appropriate services.
+ Docker: Containerized services for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
+ Kubernetes: Managed container orchestration for automated deployment, scaling, and management of services.
+ SQL/NoSQL Databases: Leveraged for data persistence, offering flexibility in data storage.
